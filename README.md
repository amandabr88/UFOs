## Overview of Project
Create an interactive website that  provides a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 
For specification of this project, we have added the table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

The user can use one or all five filters to chack the data. 

For example, below you can see in the screenshot the data filtered only by shape 'circle'

And in this second one I have used 2 filters, one by state and by date.

## Summary

### Drawback
The color/font inside the filter boxes gives you the impression that the data is being filtered already.


### Recommendations

1. Change the font color to avoid confunsion in the filter boxes.
2. Allocate the the filter search box to the top of the columns instead of the side of the page.
